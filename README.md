# basicdistributions

The purpose of the package is that it is difficult to find summary statistics and information of a vector in a way that is easy to extract and view. This package solves that problem by giving summary statistics as a dataframe, and beinga able to predict what a distribution is to give a extimated distribution curve along with a histogram. 

basicdistributions contains 4 functions that deal with manipulation of basic distributions. All four of these distributions take a numeric vector as an input and examine different aspects of the vector.
Graph_it and Model_predict graph basic distributions. Distribution_guess and Sum_stat deal with more quantitative elements of vectors.
